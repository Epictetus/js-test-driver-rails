js-test-driver-rails is a thin wrapper for the JsTestDriver library: http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/

To take advantage of it, you should create a js_test_driver.rb file in your RAILS_ROOT/config/ directory.

The file may contain following directives:

includes 'foo', 'bar', 'public/javascripts/*.js' # files to be included
excludes 'public/javascripts/fail.js' # files to be excluded, useful with globbing

host 'my-laptop' # the host to which the test runner will connect, by default 'localhost'
port 6666 # the port to which test runner will connect, and on which the test server will start, by default 4224

browser 'firefox' # you can specify the default browsers which will be captured

Note, that this is a ruby file, so the file/browser list can be generated dynamically - it's completely up to you.

This gem comes with 3 rake tasks:

# start the js test driver server
rake js_test_driver:start_server

# capture the default (or specified) browsers
rake js_test_driver:capture_browsers [BROWSERS=foo,bar,baz]

# run the tests (all or the specified ones)
rake js_test_driver:run_tests [TESTS=TestCase[.testMethod]]

You can add these tasks by requiring "js_test_driver/tasks"
